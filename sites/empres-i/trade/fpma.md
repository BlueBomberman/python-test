FPMA Tool
-------------
_A web–based tool for analysis and dissemination of price data_

The [FPMA Tool](https://fpma.apps.fao.org/giews/food-prices/tool/public/#/home) is a major component of the FPMA activity. It provides an advanced technical solution for dissemination and analysis of price information. The Tool was developed in 2010 as part of FAO’s initiatives to address the soaring food prices. 

The first version of the tool was developed with support from the Government of the Kingdom of Spain and the current version was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The tool is linked to the FPMA database, which includes monthly and weekly retail and/or wholesale prices for several food commodities in selected markets of each country. For each price series, supplementary information is included about the commodity (per capita consumption, self-sufficiency ratio) and the market (geographic location and brief description).

The FPMA Tool provides an easy way to access the large amounts of data present in the database. It allows users to quickly browse single price series, create comparisons among countries/markets/commodities, download of charts, data and basic statistics such as averages, standard deviations and percentage changes.

Besides supporting GIEWS and other FAO Units’ analysis, the FPMA Tool and database has become a valuable Public Good for providing the international community and decision-makers with timely and reliable information. The price data is used by a wide range of international organizations, academia and the media. Major users include the World Bank (WB), the World Food Programme (WFP), the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
